    <h2>Site Report – CSY1063 Web Development (AS1)</h2>

    <p>
      This portfolio website was developed as part of the CSY1063 Web Development module
      to demonstrate my understanding of client-side web technologies using HTML, CSS,
      and GitHub. The main aim of the project was to design and implement a responsive,
      multi-page portfolio website that follows modern web standards and best practices.
    </p>

    <p>
      During the development process, I learned the importance of using semantic HTML
      elements such as <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>,
      <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, and
      <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> to improve accessibility and structure. Initially,
      structuring the layout correctly was challenging, especially when managing navigation
      and page consistency, but this improved as I gained more experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      The website consists of five pages: Home, Projects, Contact, Video Demonstration,
      and Site Report. A consistent navigation menu is used across all pages, with a
      hamburger menu implemented for mobile devices using JavaScript. Media queries were
      applied to ensure the website adapts correctly to smaller screen sizes.
    </p>

    <p>
      For layout design, CSS Grid and Flexbox were used throughout the website. The Home
      and Projects pages use different grid layouts to demonstrate flexibility and design
      skills as required by the assignment. A dark-themed header with blue accent colours
      was chosen to give the website a modern and professional appearance. Subtle hover
      animations were added to buttons and cards to enhance the user experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      Debugging played a major role in the development process. Common issues included
      layout alignment problems, responsive design bugs, and navigation visibility on
      mobile devices. These issues were resolved using browser developer tools and
      validation services. All HTML and CSS files were validated using W3C validation tools.
    </p>

    <p>
      Version control was managed using GitHub, with regular commits made throughout the
      development process. This helped track progress and manage changes efficiently.
      A video demonstration explaining the website structure, design decisions, and CSS
      concepts used is included on the Video Demo page.
    </p>

    <p>
      Overall, this project significantly improved my understanding of web development
      fundamentals and gave me hands-on experience in designing, coding, testing, and
      documenting a responsive portfolio website.

  <h2>HTML & CSS Validation</h2>

  <p>
    All HTML pages and the CSS stylesheet for this portfolio website were
    validated using the official W3C validation tools. Validation was carried
    out to ensure that the code follows modern web standards, improves browser
    compatibility, and avoids structural or syntax errors.
  </p>

  <h3>HTML Validation Results</h3>

  <p>
    The successful validation of all files confirms that semantic HTML5
    elements were used correctly and that the CSS follows W3C standards.
    This contributes to accessibility, maintainability, and responsive
    behaviour across different devices and browsers.
